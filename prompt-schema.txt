I have an XSD schema that is intended to define the enumeration of instances for launching SeaweedFS, including all possible arguments.

Below is the description of the commands:

help.txt

I need to refine the XSD schema to ensure it aligns with the list of commands.
Below is the current XSD schema:

seaweedfs-systemd.xsd

Please provide the updated schema in its entirety.
